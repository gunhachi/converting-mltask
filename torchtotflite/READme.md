2. Tensorflow : latest
3. Torch and Torchvision
4. onnx , onnx-runtime and onnx-tf
5. Numpy
6. Pandas
7. opencv-python

## Run the program
Follow each step provided in the table of contens.
If you try to use the local machine, i suggest to install each of requirements manually by `pip install [requirement-module]` .
